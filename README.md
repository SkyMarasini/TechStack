TechStack: Eat Languages, Not Apples
Welcome to TechStack, the classic snake game reimagined for coders and curious folks! Instead of munching on apples, your snake consumes programming languages to grow. The goal? Collect as much as you can and become the ultimate polyglot serpent! 🧠💻

🎮 Gameplay Overview

Instead of apples, you'll find icons representing programming languages.
Each time you eat a language, your snake grows longer.
The game ends if you crash into yourself or the walls.
Collect as much as available languages!
